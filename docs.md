### Usage

The easiest way to use JSHint is to install it as a Node program. To do so,
simply run the following command in your terminal (flag -g installs JSHint
globally on your system, omit it if you want to install JSHint in the current
working directory):

    $ npm install jshint -g
    
After you've done that you should be able to use the `jshint` program. The
simplest use case would be linting a single file or all JavaScript files in
a directory:

    $ jshint myfile.js
    myfile.js: line 10, col 39, Octal literals are not allowed in strict mode.
    
    1 error

JSHint comes with a default set of warnings but it was designed to be very
configurable. There are two main ways to configure your copy of JSHint before:
you can either specify the configuration file manually via the `--config` flag
or use a special file `.jshintrc`. JSHint will look for this file in the current
working directory and, if not found, will move one level up the directory tree
all the way up to the filesystem root.

This setup allows you to have different configuration files per project. Place
your file into the project root directory and, as long as you run JSHint from
anywhere within your project directory tree, the same configuration file will
be used.

Configuration file is a simple JSON file that specifies which JSHint options
to turn on or off. For example, the following file will enable warnings about
undefined and unused variables and tell JSHint about a global variable named
`MY_GLOBAL`.

    {
      "undef": true,
      "unused": true,
      "globals": [ "MY_GLOBAL" ]
    }

Other configuration flags supported by JSHint:

* **`--reporter`**
  Allows you to modify JSHint's output by replacing its default output function
  with your own implementation.

      $ jshint --reporter=myreporter.js myfile.js
  
  This flag also supports two pre-defined reporters: *jslint*, to make output
  compatible with JSLint, and *checkstyle*, to make output compatible with
  CheckStyle XML.

      $ jshint --reporter=checkstyle myfile.js
      <?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
      <checkstyle version="4.3">
      	<file name="myfile.js">
          <error line="10" column="39" severity="error"
            message="Octal literals are not allowed in strict mode."/>
        </file>
      </checkstyle>
      
  See also: [Writing your own JSHint reporter](/docs/reporter/).

* **`--verbose`**
  Adds message codes to the JSHint output.

* **`--show-non-errors`**
  Shows additional data generated by JSHint.

      $ jshint --show-non-errors myfile.js
      myfile.js: line 10, col 39, Octal literals are not allowed in strict mode.
    
      1 error
      
      myfile.js:
        Unused variables:
          foo, bar

* **`--extra-ext`**
  Allows you to specify additional file extensions to check (default is .js).

* **`--help`**
  Shows a nice little help message similar to what you're reading right now.

* **`--version`**
  Shows the installed version of JSHint.
  
#### Rhino

JSHint also has a Rhino build which you can download [here](/todo/).

    $ rhino jshint-rhino.js myfile.js
    
Note that Rhino version doesn't support flags described above. It is, actually,
pretty basic.

### JSHint as a JavaScript library

You can also use JSHint in your projects as a JavaScript library. You can either
install it as a Node module and include with `require` or [download our web
bundle](/todo/) which exposes a global `JSHINT` function.

    // With Node
    var JSHINT = require("jshint").JSHINT;
    
`JSHINT` is a function that takes three formal parameters and returns a boolean:

    var success = JSHINT(source, options, globals);
    
The first parameter is either a string or an array of strings. If it is a
string, it will be split on '\n' or '\r'. If it is an array of strings, it is
assumed that each string represents one line. The source can be JavaScript or
JSON.

The second parameter is an optional object of options which control the
operation of JSHINT. Most of the options are booleans: They are all optional and
have a default value of false.

The third parameter is an object of global variables, with keys as names and a
boolean value to determine if they are assignable.

If your input passes JSHint tests, the function will return `true`. Otherwise,
it will return `false`. In that case, you can use `JSHINT.errors` to retrieve
the errors or request a complete report by calling the `JSHINT.data()` method.

### Configuring JSHint from within JavaScript files

In addition to the `--config` flag and `.jshintrc` file you can configure JSHint
from within your files using special comments. For example, the following
snippet will enable warnings about undefined and unused variables and tell
JSHint about a global variable named `MY_GLOBAL`.

    /* jshint undef: true, unused: true */
    /* global MY_GLOBAL */
    
These comments are function scoped meaning that if you put them inside a
function they will affect only this function's code.

### Ignoring files

If you want JSHint to skip some files you can list them in a file named
`.jshintignore`. For example:

    legacy.js
    somelib/**
    
JSHint uses [minimatch](https://github.com/isaacs/minimatch) for glob matching.
